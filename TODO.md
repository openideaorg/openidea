# Outstanding Tasks

- Implement pages for the navigation links in `Header.tsx` (`/openresources`, `/projects`, `/community`, `/whitepaper`).
- Fix ESLint warnings shown by `npm run lint` (e.g. `react/no-unescaped-entities` in multiple components).
- Consolidate `tailwind.config.ts` and `tailwind.config.mjs` to a single configuration file.
- Add automated tests and continuous integration; currently no `npm test` script.
- Review dependency versions and update as needed.
- Expand the README with more detailed setup and contribution guidelines.
