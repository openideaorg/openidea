# Design Decisions

OpenIdea is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and styled using Tailwind CSS. The project aims for a minimal setup so newcomers can easily contribute.

- **Next.js App Router** is used for file-based routing and server components.
- **Tailwind CSS** provides utility-first styling.
- **Dark mode** is implemented with `next-themes`.

Further design discussions will be documented here as the project evolves.
